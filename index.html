                I wanted to see how the COVID pandemic affected crime in the city of Chicago.

                                We can see that the overall rates are fairly high - particularly for battery, assault and criminal damage.

                                We can see that the rates for the three highest in the prior slide (assault, battery, and criminal damage) all went down.
                                Battery in particular went from approx 49,000 to approx 41,000.
